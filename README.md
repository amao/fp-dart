# fpdart

Functional programming in Dart 

Inspired by [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts), [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz), [cyclops](https://github.com/aol/cyclops).

# Dart compatibility
Running with Dart 2.1+ (mixin keyword was introduced in Dart 2.1)

If you are running < Dart 2.1, you should use `abstract class` instead.
